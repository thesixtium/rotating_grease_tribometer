## Circular grease Tribometer
There was a linear tribometer already set up in the Nanotribology lab, and some mechanical work had been done by a previous research assistant towards making it circular. All the mechanical had already been set up, so it was mostly assembling it, adjusting parts, and making the software.

### Link to GitHub
You can find the project-specific GitHub here:
[thesixtium/rotating_grease_tribometer](https://github.com/thesixtium/rotating_grease_tribometer)

### What's Been Done
* All the mechanical has been figured out and assembled
* Calibration files and software have been found, loaded, and run
* The control software has been created in LabVIEW by adapting parts from other part-specific control softwares
* All of the electrical wiring has been cleaned up (removing useless wires, cable management, etc.).

### What Needs to Happen
* The software made is only a foundation, versions of this foundational software need to be made and modified to automatically run specific experiments.

### Documentation
* The LabVIEW software contains documentation and labelling within it.
* There is also a supporting powerpoint in the project-specific GitHub.
